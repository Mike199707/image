# Be My Valentine? 💘

A fun, interactive Valentine's Day web page!  
Users are greeted with a question: *"Will you be my valentine?"* and playful **Yes / No buttons**. The **No button moves around**, and clicking **Yes** changes the image and shows a cute message.

This project is built with **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — no frameworks required.
